I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser using HTML, CSS, powered by JavaScript. 

## How it functions

When a user clicks on the generate password button. A series of prompts will appear asking for user criteria that he or she would like to use in their password. The password must be between 8-128 characters long. It must include one character type and if the user doesnt pick one, they will be reminded to do so. The password generator will display a randomized password in the box above the generate password button.
